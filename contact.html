<h1>Conditions of use</h1>
<p>Ordering
By completing and submitting an electronic order form, you are making an offer to purchase goods which, if accepted by us, will result in a binding contract. Please note that products will not be sent (or links to online products) until we have authorization from your payment card issuer. We will not be liable if there is a delay, and we will not accept your order if payment is not authorized.
Certain steps must be followed for a contract to be formed, as described below.
After you have placed your order:
You will receive an email to acknowledge your order. It will confirm which products you have ordered, but it may not constitute an acceptance of your order. You may be directed to a third-party site to complete your order.
We do not have to accept your order, and for example, we will not accept your order if
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    We do not have the products in stock
  </li>
  <li>
    Your payment is not authorized
  </li>
  <li>
  There is an error on our website regarding the price or other details of the products
  </li>
  <li>
    You have canceled your order
  </li>

</ul>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse any order.</p>
<h3>Returning products after sending</h3>
<p>Each product sold through Legal Ease Consulting, Inc. and the Lawyer Meltdown site is guaranteed. If you are not satisfied with the product after receiving it, contact us for return of the payment price, as indicated in the guarantee.</p>
<h3>Pricing and payment</h3>
<p>Prices throughout the website are quoted in Egyptian pounds, and payment can only be accepted in Egyptian pounds. Packing and delivery costs, if any, will be added to the total price of your purchase.
While we make every effort to ensure that the products shown on our website are currently available at the price shown, we cannot guarantee that this will always be the case. If products you have ordered are unavailable, you will be notified as soon as possible.
The price you pay is the price of the products shown at the time you place your order, even if the price of the product has since changed.
Your payment card will be debited for your order at the time the order is placed. By submitting an online order with Legal Ease Consulting, Inc. through the Lawyer Meltdown website, you expressly agree not to request a ‘charge back’ of any fees or payments for said orders, and that no dispute with Legal Ease Consulting will be raised with or adjudicated by the credit card company. Rather, you agree to contact Legal Ease Consulting, Inc. directly to resolve the issue or obtain a refund pursuant to the product guarantee.
Where an offer mentions that an item is reduced in price, eg: half-price, the discount will be calculated at checkout before any postage or packaging charges are applied.

<h3>Changes to Terms & Conditions for buying products online</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to change these Terms & Conditions for buying products online from time to time. If this happens, we will notify you by posting the new Terms & Conditions for buying products online on the website. If you do not wish to be governed by the revised Terms & Conditions for buying products online, you must not place any further orders.
These Terms & Conditions are governed by the law of the United States and the State of New York and you and we agree to use the New York courts should any dispute arise.
If any part of these Terms & Conditions for buying products online is found to be invalid by law, the rest of them remain valid and enforceable.
